# KyPost Push Relay (Cloudflare Worker)

This Worker centralizes native (FCM) push delivery for KyPost.

The published mobile app is compiled against **one** Firebase project, so only a
holder of that project's service account can deliver push to it. Instead of
shipping that credential to every self-hosted server, the **maintainer** runs
this one Worker. Self-hosted KyPost servers forward push requests to it,
each authenticated with its own API key. Self-hosters need **no Firebase account
and never recompile the app**.

```
self-hosted Go server  --(Bearer per-server key)-->  this Worker  --(service account)-->  FCM
```

## One-time setup (maintainer)

1. Install deps and log in:
   ```sh
   cd worker
   npm install
   npx wrangler login
   ```
2. Create your local config, then create the two KV namespaces and paste the
   returned ids into it. `wrangler.toml` is gitignored (it holds your live KV
   ids); `wrangler.toml.example` is the committed template:
   ```sh
   cp wrangler.toml.example wrangler.toml
   npx wrangler kv namespace create API_KEYS
   npx wrangler kv namespace create OAUTH_CACHE
   ```
3. Set secrets from your Firebase service-account JSON (the same file the Go
   backend used as `FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE`):
   ```sh
   npx wrangler secret put FCM_CLIENT_EMAIL   # "client_email"
   npx wrangler secret put FCM_PRIVATE_KEY    # "private_key" (full PEM, keep newlines)
   npx wrangler secret put FCM_PROJECT_ID     # "project_id"
   npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_SECRET       # a long random string you choose
   ```
4. Deploy:
   ```sh
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```

## Self-registration (no maintainer involvement)

Self-hosted servers get a key on their own — you don't issue anything. The Go
backend does this automatically: on first start with `PUSH_RELAY_URL` set and no
`PUSH_RELAY_KEY`, it calls `/register`, then persists the key under `SECRET_DIR`
and reuses it on every restart. Equivalent by hand:

```sh
curl -X POST https://<your-worker>.workers.dev/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"label":"alice-server"}'
# -> {"id":"...","label":"alice-server","key":"<RAW KEY>","expiresAt":null}
```

**One active key per IP.** Registering again from the same IP mints a new key and
**invalidates the previous one** — so a server that loses its key file just
re-registers and keeps working, and a single IP can't accumulate keys. Servers
behind the same public IP therefore share one key slot (the latest wins).

Self-registered keys never expire and are tagged `"source":"self"` (with the
registering IP) in the admin list, so you can audit and revoke abusers. Abuse is
further bounded by the per-key rolling rate limits and the `REGISTRATION_ENABLED
= "false"` kill-switch. To cap how often one IP can churn keys, add a Cloudflare
rate-limit rule on the `/register` route.

## Issuing a key manually (optional)

You can still mint keys yourself — e.g. to pre-provision a server or set an
expiry:

```sh
curl -X POST https://<your-worker>.workers.dev/admin/keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"label":"alice-server"}'
# -> {"id":"...","label":"alice-server","key":"<RAW KEY, shown only once>","expiresAt":null}
```

Optionally give the key an expiry — either a lifetime in days or an explicit
ISO timestamp (an explicit `expiresAt` wins over `ttlDays`):

```sh
-d '{"label":"alice-server","ttlDays":90}'
-d '{"label":"alice-server","expiresAt":"2027-01-01T00:00:00Z"}'
```

Give the self-hoster the raw `key` (out of band). They set on their server:

```
PUSH_RELAY_URL=https://<your-worker>.workers.dev
PUSH_RELAY_KEY=<the raw key>
```

List keys: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_SECRET" .../admin/keys`
Revoke:    `curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_SECRET" .../admin/keys/<id>`

`GET /admin/keys` returns per-key metadata and source:

```json
{ "keys": [ {
  "id": "…", "label": "alice-server", "enabled": true,
  "createdAt": "2026-07-04T…", "expiresAt": null, "expired": false,
  "source": "self", "registeredIp": "203.0.113.7"
} ] }
```

Send counts and last-seen are **not** here — they're recorded in Analytics Engine
(see [Usage](#usage)). Expired keys stay listed (with `"expired": true`) until you
revoke them, so you can see which keys lapsed.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path              | Auth                   | Purpose                          |
| ------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/health`         | none                   | Liveness + whether configured    |
| POST   | `/register`       | none                   | Self-issue a per-server key      |
| POST   | `/send`           | Bearer per-server key  | Deliver one push                 |
| POST   | `/admin/keys`     | Bearer `ADMIN_SECRET`  | Mint a key (returns raw key once)|
| GET    | `/admin/keys`     | Bearer `ADMIN_SECRET`  | List key metadata + last-used    |
| DELETE | `/admin/keys/{id}`| Bearer `ADMIN_SECRET`  | Revoke a key                     |

`POST /send` body:

```json
{ "token": "<FCM registration token>", "title": "…", "body": "…", "data": { "url": "/read" }, "platform": "android" }
```

Responses: `200 {"ok":true}` on delivery; `403` when the token is already
claimed by a different active key (see Token pinning below); `410 {"stale":true}`
when the token is no longer registered (the Go server then removes the
device); `401` for a bad or expired key; `429` when the per-key rate limit is
exceeded (body has `"window":"minute"` and a `Retry-After` header); `502` for
other upstream FCM errors. Error bodies include a `requestId` that matches the
`X-Request-Id` response header and the structured logs.

## Token pinning

The first key to successfully deliver to a given device token "claims" it;
every later `/send` to that token must come from the same key, or it's
rejected with `403`. This closes the open-relay gap self-registration
otherwise leaves: without it, any registered key could spoof push to any
device token, including ones it has no business reaching. A claim is
automatically released for reclaiming if the owning key is later revoked,
disabled, or expires — so rotating your key never permanently orphans your
own devices, it just re-claims them on the next successful send.

## Rate limiting

Each key is capped by a **per-minute** limit on `/send`, enforced by the native
`PUSH_RATE_LIMITER` binding in `wrangler.toml` (`simple = { limit = 10, period =
60 }`) — a fixed 60s window with **no KV writes**. Change the limit there and
redeploy. `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` in `[vars]` is display-only (`/health` + the
429 body) and should be kept equal to `simple.limit`. Exceeding it returns `429`
with `{"error":"rate limit exceeded","window":"minute","limit":10,"retryAfterSeconds":60}`.

> **Hour/day rolling limits were removed for now.** They required a KV
> read-modify-write on every accepted send, which capped the free tier at
> ~1,000 pushes/day. Dropping them keeps an accepted send at **zero KV writes**.
> Restore rolling hour/day caps with Durable Objects (exact, atomic, no KV write
> pressure) once running on Workers Paid — see the `TODO(paid-tier)` in
> `src/index.ts`.

## Usage

Each accepted send writes one data point to the `USAGE_ANALYTICS` Analytics
Engine dataset (`kypost_push_usage`) — off the KV write path — with the key id,
label, and source. Query totals and last-seen per key via the Analytics Engine
SQL API, e.g.:

```sql
SELECT blob1 AS key_id, sum(_sample_interval * double1) AS sends, max(timestamp) AS last_seen
FROM kypost_push_usage GROUP BY key_id ORDER BY sends DESC
```

The admin list no longer carries usage counts or `lastUsedAt` — that all lives in
Analytics Engine now.

## Observability

- Every request is assigned a UUID `requestId`, returned in the `X-Request-Id`
  header (and in error bodies). Each request emits one structured JSON log line
  (plus event lines for sends, denials, and key changes). Tail them live with
  `npx wrangler tail`, or ship them via Workers Logs / Logpush.
- `GET /health` returns `{ ok, configured, rateLimits: { perMinute },
  registrationEnabled }` with no auth — use it for uptime checks. `configured` is
  false until all FCM secrets are set.

## Notes

- Only the SHA-256 hash of each API key is stored in KV; the raw key is shown
  once at creation.
- The Google OAuth access token is cached in the `OAUTH_CACHE` KV namespace and
  refreshed ~1 minute before expiry. Key records and the `ipkey:<ip>` indexes
  (one key per IP) live in `API_KEYS`.
- An accepted send performs **no KV writes**: the minute limiter uses the native
  binding, usage goes to Analytics Engine, and the hour/day KV log is gone. The
  remaining per-send KV cost is reads (key lookup + OAuth cache), so the free
  tier now scales to tens of thousands of pushes/day.
