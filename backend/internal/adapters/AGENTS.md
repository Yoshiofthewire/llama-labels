# Adapters

## Purpose

External protocol clients that isolate third-party integration details from the rest of the backend. Contains two sub-packages: `imap/` and `classifier/`.

## Ownership

All code under `backend/internal/adapters/`. Owned by the backend team. Changes to either adapter affect the classification loop and must be coordinated with `processor/`.

## Local Contracts

### `imap/` — IMAP Client

- Wraps `go-imap` to fetch unread emails by UID range from a configured mailbox
- Reads IMAP credentials from an encrypted file at rest (decrypted at connection time via `SECRET_DIR`)
- Does not cache or buffer messages; callers receive a slice of messages and are responsible for processing
- Returns errors on connection failure; callers (processor) handle retry logic

### `classifier/` — Classifier HTTP Client

- Sends classification requests to Ollama `/api/generate` via HTTP POST
- Enforces a minimum 3-second gap between consecutive requests (`http_client.go` pacing)
- Implements exponential backoff on transient HTTP errors
- `client.go` — high-level interface: accepts prompt + email text, returns raw model output string
- `http_client.go` — low-level transport: handles request construction, pacing timer, retry loop

### Shared Rules

- Adapters do not read or write application state (`STATE_DIR`)
- Adapters do not call other internal packages; they receive all config via constructor arguments
- All external I/O errors are returned to callers, not swallowed

## Work Guidance

- Keep each sub-package's external interface minimal: one constructor, one or two methods
- Pacing and retry logic lives exclusively in `http_client.go`; do not duplicate in `client.go`
- IMAP credential decryption must use the same key derivation as `api/` encryption — coordinate any changes with `api/server.go`

## Verification

- `go vet ./internal/adapters/...` must pass
- Integration tests requiring live IMAP or Ollama endpoints are run manually; unit tests mock the HTTP transport

## Child DOX Index

No child AGENTS.md files. `imap/` and `classifier/` are documented here.
