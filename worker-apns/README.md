# KyPost Push Relay (APNs) — Cloudflare Worker

This Worker delivers native push notifications to iOS devices via Apple Push Notification service (APNs).

The published iOS app is compiled with a single bundle ID (`com.urlxl.mail`), so only a holder of the corresponding Apple Developer Team ID can deliver push to it. Instead of shipping the APNs auth key (`.p8`) to every self-hosted server, the **maintainer** runs this Worker. Self-hosted KyPost servers forward push requests to it, each authenticated with its own API key. Self-hosters need **no Apple Developer account and never recompile the app**.

```
self-hosted Go server  --(Bearer per-server key)-->  this Worker  --(APNs provider token)-->  APNs  -->  iOS Device
```

## One-time setup (maintainer)

1. Install deps and log in:
   ```sh
   cd worker-apns
   npm install
   npx wrangler login
   ```

2. Create your local config, then create the two KV namespaces and paste the returned ids into it. `wrangler.toml` is gitignored (it holds your live KV ids); `wrangler.toml.example` is the committed template:
   ```sh
   cp wrangler.toml.example wrangler.toml
   npx wrangler kv namespace create API_KEYS
   npx wrangler kv namespace create APNS_TOKEN_CACHE
   # Paste the returned namespace IDs into wrangler.toml for their respective bindings
   ```

3. Obtain an APNs Auth Key from the Apple Developer portal:
   - Log in to https://developer.apple.com/account
   - Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → Keys
   - Click "+" to create a new key
   - Check "Apple Push Notifications service (APNs)" capability
   - Click "Continue", then "Register"
   - **Download the `.p8` file immediately** (it can't be re-downloaded — losing it means revoking the Key ID and creating a new one)
   - Note the **Key ID** (shown in the list) and your **Team ID** (visible in the top-right account menu)

4. Set secrets:
   ```sh
   npx wrangler secret put APNS_AUTH_KEY    # Contents of the .p8 file (preserve all newlines)
   npx wrangler secret put APNS_KEY_ID      # Key ID from step 3
   npx wrangler secret put APNS_TEAM_ID     # Team ID from your Apple Developer account
   npx wrangler secret put APNS_TOPIC       # Bundle ID, e.g. "com.urlxl.mail"
   npx wrangler secret put APNS_ENVIRONMENT # "production" or "sandbox" (use "sandbox" for debug/TestFlight builds)
   npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_SECRET     # A long random string you choose (guards /admin/keys endpoints)
   ```

5. Deploy:
   ```sh
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```

## Self-registration (no maintainer involvement)

Same as the FCM worker: self-hosted servers get a key on their own. The Go backend does this automatically: on first start with `APNS_RELAY_URL` set and no `APNS_RELAY_KEY`, it calls `/register`, persists the key, and reuses it on every restart.

```sh
curl -X POST https://<your-worker>.workers.dev/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"label":"alice-server"}'
# -> {"id":"...","label":"alice-server","key":"<RAW KEY>","expiresAt":null}
```

**One active key per IP.** Registering from an IP that already holds a key invalidates the previous one — so a server that loses its key file can re-register and keep working.

## Issuing a key manually (optional)

You can mint keys yourself — e.g. to pre-provision a server or set an expiry:

```sh
curl -X POST https://<your-worker>.workers.dev/admin/keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"label":"alice-server"}'
# -> {"id":"...","label":"alice-server","key":"<RAW KEY, shown only once>","expiresAt":null}
```

Optionally give the key an expiry — either a lifetime in days or an explicit ISO timestamp:

```sh
-d '{"label":"alice-server","ttlDays":90}'
-d '{"label":"alice-server","expiresAt":"2027-01-01T00:00:00Z"}'
```

Give the self-hoster the raw `key` (out of band). They set on their server:

```
APNS_RELAY_URL=https://<your-worker>.workers.dev
APNS_RELAY_KEY=<the raw key>
```

List keys: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_SECRET" .../admin/keys`
Revoke:    `curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_SECRET" .../admin/keys/<id>`

## Environment-specific deployment

If you want separate dev/sandbox and production workers:

1. Duplicate `wrangler.toml` → `wrangler.prod.toml`
2. Update each config's namespace IDs and `APNS_ENVIRONMENT` secret accordingly
3. Deploy:
   ```sh
   npx wrangler deploy --env dev
   npx wrangler deploy --env prod
   ```
4. Point the Go backend to both:
   - `APNS_RELAY_URL=https://<your-worker-dev>.workers.dev` (uses sandbox)
   - Or override per-environment via your infrastructure's environment promotion pipeline

## Endpoints

| Method | Path              | Auth                   | Purpose                          |
| ------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/health`         | none                   | Liveness + whether configured    |
| POST   | `/register`       | none                   | Self-issue a per-server key      |
| POST   | `/send`           | Bearer per-server key  | Deliver one push                 |
| POST   | `/admin/keys`     | Bearer `ADMIN_SECRET`  | Mint a key (returns raw key once)|
| GET    | `/admin/keys`     | Bearer `ADMIN_SECRET`  | List key metadata                |
| DELETE | `/admin/keys/{id}`| Bearer `ADMIN_SECRET`  | Revoke a key                     |

`POST /send` body:

```json
{
  "token": "<raw APNs device token (64-char hex)>",
  "title": "Alice Smith",
  "body": "Project Update",
  "data": { "messageId": "msg-123", "url": "/read" }
}
```

Responses:
- `200 {"ok":true}` on delivery
- `410 {"stale":true}` when the token is no longer registered (Go server then removes the device)
- `401` for a bad or expired key
- `429` when the per-key rate limit is exceeded (body has `"window":"minute"` and a `Retry-After` header)
- `502` for upstream APNs errors or transient failures
- Error bodies include a `requestId` that matches the `X-Request-Id` response header

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `InvalidToken` / `Unauthorized` (HTTP 403) | Auth key is incorrect, expired, or revoked | Regenerate the `.p8` key in Apple Developer portal and rotate the secret |
| `BadDeviceToken` (HTTP 400) | Device token is malformed or stale | Device was uninstalled or re-registered; backend automatically re-tries registration on next notification |
| `DeviceTokenNotForTopic` (HTTP 400) | Token was registered for a different bundle ID | Provisioning profile mismatch; rebuild the app with the correct bundle ID |
| `Unregistered` (HTTP 400) | Device revoked APNs permission or uninstalled app | Same as BadDeviceToken |
| `410 Gone` | Token is expired/revoked | Device was uninstalled; backend removes the device |
| HTTP 429 Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded | Increase `limit` in `wrangler.toml`'s `PUSH_RATE_LIMITER` binding or implement per-user throttling in the Go backend |

## Rate limiting

Each key is capped by a **per-minute** limit on `/send`, enforced by the native `PUSH_RATE_LIMITER` binding in `wrangler.toml` (`simple = { limit = 10, period = 60 }`) — a fixed 60s window with **no KV writes**. Change the limit there and redeploy. `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` in `[vars]` is display-only (`/health` + the 429 body) and should be kept equal to `simple.limit`. Exceeding it returns `429` with `{"error":"rate limit exceeded","window":"minute","limit":10,"retryAfterSeconds":60}`.

> **Hour/day rolling limits were removed for now.** They required a KV read-modify-write on every accepted send, which capped the free tier at ~1,000 pushes/day. Dropping them keeps an accepted send at **zero KV writes**.

## HTTP/2 and Payload Compatibility

APNs requires HTTP/2. Cloudflare Workers' `fetch()` automatically negotiates HTTP/2 via ALPN. All current Cloudflare plans support HTTP/2.

Both the FCM (Android) and APNs (iOS) workers receive identical request payloads from the Go backend:

```json
{
  "token": "device-token-here",
  "title": "Alice Smith",
  "body": "Project Update",
  "data": {
    "messageId": "msg-123",
    "senderName": "Alice Smith",
    "emailSubject": "Project Update",
    "Keywords": "work,important"
  }
}
```

The APNs worker translates this to the APS payload:

```json
{
  "aps": {
    "alert": { "title": "Alice Smith", "body": "Project Update" },
    "sound": "default",
    "mutable-content": 1
  },
  "messageId": "msg-123",
  "senderName": "Alice Smith",
  "emailSubject": "Project Update",
  "Keywords": "work,important"
}
```

Both platforms handle the full payload identically client-side.

## Provider Token Lifecycle

The APNs provider token (signed JWT from the `.p8` key) is cached for ~29 minutes (Apple accepts tokens valid for ~60 min). The Worker automatically refreshes it before expiry. If a token becomes invalid (key revoked, new Key ID issued), the Worker detects the failure and clears the cache, forcing regeneration on the next send.

**Annual key rotation:** Apple sends renewal notices before the `.p8` key expires (certificate expiry is separate from key validity). Plan to regenerate the key yearly — download the new `.p8`, rotate the `APNS_AUTH_KEY` secret, and redeploy. The Worker detects invalid tokens and recovers gracefully; no downtime needed.
